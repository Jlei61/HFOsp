# Topic 4 rev12-ND execution plan

## Phase 0: freeze and audit

1. Snapshot the current Node field, 12-network baseline, patient target hashes,
   classifier and detector.
2. Record that patient held-out blocks have already been inspected and are
   development confirmation only.
3. Verify exact Node reconstruction, fixed mass, EE/E-to-I no-op and Z/M off.

## Phase 1: scoring implementation

1. Move event-feature, weighted `R2`, event-cloud and contrast metrics into a
   reusable module.
2. Implement the four-component per-mode distance, recording-block excess-noise
   calibration and weakest-mode LSE; retain raw and normalized components.
3. Implement event-level source maps and mode-template reliability.
4. Add the seven synthetic controls from the spec.
5. Freeze a versioned patient-scoring sidecar.

## Phase 2: historical rescore

1. Inventory compatible V3-V6, D6 and rev11 Node artifacts.
2. Reconstruct frozen patient labels for every returned event.
3. Score complete event distribution and both modes with equal network weight.
4. Group only identical field hashes within the current spatial-OU stratum,
   deduplicate network seeds, then produce a field-level Pareto table.
5. Do not infer source topology where spike-level sidecars are absent.

## Phase 3: source-topology canary

1. Extend the Node worker to write 1 mm event onset maps without retaining the
   full spike matrix on disk.
2. Run current baseline on three canary networks.
3. Check mode-conditioned split-half reliability and one/two-source diagnostics.
4. Stop and repair the metric if stable synthetic templates and shuffled
   templates are not separated.

## Phase 4: same-checkpoint intervention

1. Select one evaluable TA and one evaluable TB event algorithmically.
2. Capture a checkpoint 40 ms before each event.
3. Replay sham, dominant region, secondary region and matched control with the
   same RNG and spatial OU state.
4. Confirm pre-intervention byte parity and quantify mode-selective effects.

## Phase 5: Node-only field search

1. Freeze current field and historical non-dominated fields as initial points.
2. Stage A: 4 x 4 smooth residual, common-random-number fit pool.
3. Select a small Pareto shortlist on fresh networks.
4. Stage B: optional 6 x 6 residual only around a Stage-A candidate that improves
   both patient modes without topology collapse.
5. Long runs use `systemd-run --user` plus `nohup`, one numerical thread per
   worker, memory sentinels and a 600 s monitor.  Worker count is selected from
   measured RSS while retaining at least 32 GiB available RAM.

## Phase 6: frozen confirmation and figures

1. Freeze one candidate before confirmation networks are opened.
2. Run paired current-baseline/candidate confirmation.
3. Generate the five figure products in the spec and inspect PNG/PDF/GIF.
4. Write a result report with safe claim, largest remaining gap and the exact
   handoff boundary for EE/E-to-I/Z/M.

## Current execution order

The machine currently carries another high-load Topic 4 cohort.  Phases 0-2 are
zero-simulation and proceed immediately.  Phase 3 begins only when measured
resources allow at least three Node workers without reducing the reserved memory
margin.  The run is not accelerated by lowering duration or reusing selection
networks.
